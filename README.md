# phd_thesis
This repository gathers the codes associated to my phd manuscript.
The first code is related to the second chapter "sparse regular variation" and provides a comparison of our approach
with the one developed by Goix, Sabourin, Clemencon (2017).
The second one is related to the third chapter "tail inference for high-dimensional data" and provides numerical examples
which illustrate the algorithm introduced in this chapter.
